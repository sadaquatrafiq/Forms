   <p> A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. 
       Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform 
       a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), 
       and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function 
       together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
        Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
         computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the 
         Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual 
         instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, 
         some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical 
         machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed 
         during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and 
         monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. 
         The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid
          pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.Conventionally, 
          a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, 
          along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical 
          operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include
           input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both 
           functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the 
           result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
